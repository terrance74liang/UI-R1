## 🔥 Overview

We propose **UI-R1**, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks.

Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed **UI-R1-3B** achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of **22.1%** on ScreenSpot, **6.0%** on ScreenSpot-Pro, and **12.7%** on AndroidControl. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples.

## Setup

```shell
conda create -n ui-r1 python=3.10
conda activate ui-r1
bash setup.sh
```

## Data

Our training mobile data is a subset from AndroidControl and ScreenSpot.

You can also prepare your training or inference data like:

```
images/:
	image1.png
	image2.png
```

```
test.json:
[
	{
	"img_filename": "image1.png",
        "bbox": [
            825,
            72,
            1673,
            149
        ],
        "instruction": "search bar"
     },
     {
	"img_filename": "image2.png",
        "bbox": [
            123,
            732,
            334,
            812
        ],
        "instruction": "check weather"
     }
]
```

where bbox : [x1,y1,x2,y2] is the coordinate of the left top and the right bottom of the ground truth bbox

## Inference

We provide an example here

```shell
cd evaluation/
bash test.sh
```

Please fill the MODEL_PATH, IMG_PATH, TEST_JSON with your real checkpoint path and data path.
## Training

```shell
cd src/script/
bash train.sh
```
